# E2E-Automatic-Testing-with-Playwright

This project demonstrates **End-to-End (E2E) Test Automation** applied on a **To-Do application**, showcasing the most important concepts of modern test automation.  
The goal is to provide a hands-on example of how to design, structure, and run reliable E2E tests in a real-world scenario.

## Project Overview
The To-Do application is a simple task manager where users can:
- Authentication
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Test APIs

This project automates these flows to ensure the application works as expected from a **user‚Äôs perspective**.
